## Developer Guide
1. Download a copy of bowfolios-mobile. You can download either using Github Desktop (recommended
) or by extracting the .zip. As the repo is currently private, please contact one of the
 developers to get the download.

2. Run ``npm install`` to install the dependencies.

3. You can run the project in two ways, using an emulator ([Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio)) or through Expo.

### Database Model
For our database we used Firebase real-time storage and Firebase's Auth API to handle
 authentication for user creation and login.

Our database is similar to the one implemented in [bowfolios](https://bowfolios.github.io/), where we provided pair-wise relations for all 3 primary collections: Profiles, Projects, and
 Interests. They were connected through primary keys such as email, project name, and interest name.
